add 'stop' action to stop moving (also fired when hitting a border)
display a message at the end of a fight (if alive)
slow typing messages maybe
how to make water super dangerous, but still crossable in case random doesn't make the map possible? -> not crossable. too bad if map is unsolvable
 -> find a way to build a map while it's possible to solve it (like water can't be near water ?), maybe put water only on diagonal cells
find how to solve work (how the time can be lowered if multiple ppl on the cell)
in the log at start, describe all the teams with number of ppl in it. 
after a fight (which happens when COMMAND = fight (autocreated once ennemies on cell) and ennemies = 0), reply 'xx lost'. meaning we need to store in the command itself the number of ppl alive, so we can, once fight ended, calculate the difference
command move replies 'moving to %direction'
