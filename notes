add a status command
display a message at the end of a fight (if alive)
create a new command 'move around', that will get all the cells around some team, and check if they are usable (not water, actualy place_for_npc'). and every 30 minutes or whatever the delay, if we are in original_x original_y, then move to a random place from the list, if not move to x y (so it's moving around approximately)
in the log at start, describe all the teams with number of ppl in it. or maybe in status.
change map design so that ppl don't pop on water, water can't be in the forest, etc:
	XXX XX
	
	X XXXX
	it's a matter of building the place_for_Water in that way


slow typing messages maybe
how to make water super dangerous, but still crossable in case random doesn't make the map possible? -> not crossable. too bad if map is unsolvable
 -> find a way to build a map while it's possible to solve it (like water can't be near water ?), maybe put water only on diagonal cells
find how to solve work (how the time can be lowered if multiple ppl on the cell)
after a fight (which happens when COMMAND = fight (autocreated once ennemies on cell) and ennemies = 0), reply 'xx lost'. meaning we need to store in the command itself the number of ppl alive, so we can, once fight ended, calculate the difference
command move replies 'moving to %direction'

display cursor on the query position, so we know what we are typing
