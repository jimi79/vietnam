add 'stop' action to stop moving (also fired when hitting a border)
display a message at the end of a fight (if alive)
generate random ppl name for when they die?
slow typing messages maybe
timestamp all messages in the log
once action is done, then add to the list 'defend'. end time would be None. -> nope, defend is the behavior without any action. actually, there is no defend
how to make water super dangerous, but still crossable in case random doesn't make the map possible? -> not crossable. too bad if map is unsolvable
if two teams on the same place, kill between 0 and 10% (or 0 and 1 if 10% represents less than 1) ppl on both teams
if ennemies on cell, autogenrate command 'fight'
no team merging: goals will be some place on the map where you can work, and the work load diminshes based on the number of workers. the command work would repeat itself, unless no more work to do, each 60sec (or more). each time work is done, we have the task load (a number) -= number of ppl in the team 
in the log at start, describe all the teams with number of ppl in it. 
after a fight (which happens when COMMAND = fight (autocreated once ennemies on cell) and ennemies = 0), reply 'xx lost'. meaning we need to store in the command itself the number of ppl alive, so we can, once fight ended, calculate the difference
command move replies 'moving to %direction'
