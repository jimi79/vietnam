This is a game. A very approximate simulation of the vietnam war, only in text.
The screen is separated in two zones: 
  top: log of radio
  bottom: commands sent to your teams
  
You have 4 teams:
  Alpha, Bravo and Charly: infantry team, on ground
  Delta: Helicopter
  
Infantry teams are dropped randomly (let's say they were parachuted) on a field.
They can do:
* look to look around
they will tell you what they see in 8 directions: north, north east, east, south east, south, south-west, west, north-west
* status
they will tell you the number of ppl alive in the team (randomly attributed at start), and if they are doing somethg at the moment
* move
then you give them a direction
* work
if there is somethg to be done here, any of the team can do it
* stop
stop what they are doing
* move for 5 km
move for a short distance. easier to handle when u're commanding than the other move instruction, which instructs them to move until they can't continue.

Helicopter can do one thing:
* get directions / reckon
they will report you the direction of each team to each objective

objectives:
* there are 3 objects: 
2 randoms, like getting intel for vietcongs (it's a goal that has to be completed, but doesn't give you any extra stuff)
and exit, which is required to get a lift from some heli to get out of the war zone.

how it works:
  press tab to get a list of what you can do.
    For ex, if you press tab a start, the game will add in the log the list of the team.
  giving an order:
    press the team name, and the command
    if the command is moving, then also give the direction, using the keys like so
            q w e      q is north-west, w is north, e is north-east
            a   d      a is west, d is east
            z x c      z is south-weast, x is south, c is south-east
